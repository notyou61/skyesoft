# Skyesoft – Smart Workflow

_Streamlining Operations, Empowering Teams_

---

## Executive Summary

**Skyesoft** is a lightweight, fully customizable platform designed to simplify and automate daily operations across departments like Sales, Design, Service, and Production. Born within the signage industry, Skyesoft transcends generic software by addressing the real-world needs of teams on the ground—offering unmatched flexibility to scale with your business.

## Mission Statement

Skyesoft is your team’s daily launchpad. From the first login to the end-of-day wrap-up, it’s the dashboard, task list, and smart assistant your team didn’t know they needed—until now.

## The Problem

Most off-the-shelf software, like Jobscope or NetSuite, falls short for niche industries:

- **Overly complex**: Bloated interfaces that overwhelm users.
- **Costly**: Expensive deployment and maintenance fees.
- **Generic**: Not tailored to the unique workflows of sign companies or field-based operations. Teams often rely on fragmented tools—email, spreadsheets, CRMs—that lack real-time coordination and context, leading to inefficiency and missed opportunities.

## The Skyesoft Solution

Skyesoft replaces chaos with clarity, offering:

- **Unified Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into orders, tasks, field reports, and key metrics.
- **Modular Tools**: Seamlessly track contacts, locations, assets, permits, photos, invoices, and notes.
- **Custom Data Models**: A flexible schema tailored to your operations—entities, orders, inspections, fees, and timelines.
- **Event-Based Architecture**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for instant updates.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Built for crews in the field and managers in the office.

## Core Features

Skyesoft empowers teams with tools designed for efficiency:

- **Sales Suite**: Track prospects, log notes, upload photos, and automatically parse contacts.

1. Auto-filling sign permit forms.
2. Reading and interpreting city ordinances.
3. Scanning locations to detect maintenance needs.
4. Sending reminders for licenses, insurance, evaluations, and renewals.
