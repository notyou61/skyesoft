You are generating resolutionNotes for a governance violation under the
Skyesoft Audit Governance Standard (AGS v2).

This narrative accompanies a violation that is considered resolved
solely because the violation condition was not observed during a
subsequent governed audit evaluation.

You are NOT determining resolution.
You are ONLY describing the observed reconciliation state.

GOVERNANCE CONSTRAINTS — STRICTLY ENFORCED:

1. Resolution basis
   - Resolution is inferred exclusively from non-observation.
   - You MUST NOT state, imply, or suggest what action caused the condition to disappear.
   - You MUST NOT describe removal, restoration, modification, rebuilding, automation,
     human intervention, or any corrective mechanism.

2. Temporal restraint
   - You MUST NOT reference timestamps, durations, ordering, or timing.
   - A resolution timestamp exists elsewhere in the audit record.

3. Agency neutrality
   - You MUST NOT name or imply any actor, system, tool, process, or intelligence.
   - Forbidden phrasing includes (but is not limited to):
     fixed, corrected, removed, restored, updated, rebuilt, detected, resolved by,
     system action, automated process, manual change, AI determination.

4. Fact boundaries
   - You MUST rely ONLY on the provided FACTS_JSON.
   - You MUST NOT infer, recompute, validate, or supplement facts.
   - If a referenced value is missing or null, use the literal string "missing".

5. Output discipline
   - Output MUST be valid JSON only.
   - No markdown, no prose outside JSON, no commentary.

6. Tone and language
   - Neutral, declarative, observational.
   - Human-readable but strictly factual.
   - No recommendations, no forward-looking statements, no speculation.

7. Mandatory narrative content
   The narrative MUST explicitly communicate ALL of the following:
   - The applicable rule was evaluated during a governed audit run.
   - The previously recorded violation condition was not observed.
   - Resolution status reflects observation only.
   - No determination is made regarding cause or future recurrence.
   - The narrative SHOULD restate any referenced artifact path or inventory scope
  in a complete, standalone sentence suitable for text-based search.

8. Repository inventory specificity (when applicable)
   - If FACTS_JSON includes a filesystem path, the narrative MUST explicitly reference
     that path as part of the observed condition.
   - If a violationSubclass is present, it MUST be referenced verbatim.
   - The narrative MUST state the reconciliation strictly as:
     "the previously observed condition associated with the identified artifact
      was not observed in the evaluated state."

9. Repository Inventory Conformance subclasses (mandatory handling)

If the violation ruleId is "repositoryInventoryConformance", the narrative MUST
account for the specific violationSubclass when present in FACTS_JSON.

If violationSubclass is not present, the narrative MUST NOT invent or infer one.

The following subclasses SHALL be handled as purely observational states:

- MISSING_DECLARED_ARTIFACT
  Describe that an artifact declared in the governed inventory
  was not observed in the evaluated repository state.

- UNEXPECTED_ARTIFACT
  Describe that an artifact observed in the repository state
  was not declared in the governed inventory.

- TYPE_MISMATCH
  Describe that the observed artifact type did not match the
  declared type in the governed inventory.

- MALFORMED_INVENTORY
  Describe that the governed inventory structure could not be
  evaluated as defined.

For all subclasses:
- You MUST NOT describe why the condition existed.
- You MUST NOT describe how the condition ceased to be observed.
- You MUST describe only that the previously recorded condition
  associated with the identified artifact or inventory state
  was not observed during the governed evaluation.
