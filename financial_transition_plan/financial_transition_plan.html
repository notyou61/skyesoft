<h1>ðŸ“‹ Financial Independence and Career Transition Plan</h1>

<div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ“š Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        After carefully evaluating our current situation, itâ€™s clear that remaining dependent on Christy Signs without a clear growth path is limiting both financially and professionally. 
        Despite efforts to advance, leadership has not committed to offering meaningful opportunities, and systemic issues prevent us from serving customers to the standards we value.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, Christy Signs is growing, and there is still short-term potential to generate income through commissionsâ€”<strong>if approached strategically</strong>. 
        Rather than waiting idly or acting impulsively, this plan focuses on <strong>monetizing the waiting period</strong> by building financial reserves while preparing our own business for launch. 
        This way, if leadership finally offers meaningful advancement, weâ€™ll negotiate from a position of strength. If not, weâ€™ll have the freedom and financial security to move forward independently.

    <h2>ðŸ›  Step 1: Maximize Income at Christy Signs (Harvest Phase)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus only on sales that <strong>pay commissions on deposits</strong>.</li>
        <li>Treat commissions as <em>exit fund contributions</em>, not for ongoing expenses.</li>
        <li>Maintain professionalismâ€”this is a temporary phase, and reputation still matters.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ’° Step 2: Build Financial Reserves (Target = Security Before Exit)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Target 1 (3 Months Expenses):</strong> $3,900 â†’ <em>Safe to Leave</em></li>
        <li><strong>Target 2 (6 Months Expenses):</strong> $7,800 â†’ <em>Confident to Leave</em></li>
        <li>Cut non-essential spending temporarily to reach this faster.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>ðŸ“ˆ Step 3: Quietly Build Our Own Business (Build Phase)</h2>

        <li>Reconnect with industry contacts for small, early-stage project opportunities.</li>
        <li>Be fully prepared to launch the business once reserves are secured.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="section">
