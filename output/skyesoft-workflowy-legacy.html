Our commitment is to foster a development environment where clarity, efficiency, and maintainability are paramount. These practices are not just rules but principles that guide us toward excellence in every line of code we write. Embracing these standards is our collective step towards building software that is not only robust and efficient but also a joy to work with for every member of our team.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Variable Naming Conventions
<blockquote>
<p>Use camelCase and prefix variables with var for clarity and scope definition, ensuring they are easily recognizable and logically grouped.
- CamelCase Usage
&gt; Adopt camelCase for variable names (e.g., userProfile) to enhance readability and differentiate between variables, functions, or constants.
- Var Prefix
&gt; Begin variable declarations with var to define scope explicitly and prevent unintended global variables (e.g., var itemCount).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Commenting Strategy
<blockquote>
<p>Maintain concise and descriptive comments, with title-cased statements above the code lines for quick understanding. Provide additional details next to the code for context, and align complex explanations to the right, creating clear code narration.
- Above-Line Comments
&gt; Place a succinct, title-cased comment above each line of code, focusing on the action or purpose (e.g., // Initialize Array).
- Parenthetical Clarifications
&gt; Use parentheses for additional context or nuances next to comments (e.g., // Initialize array (empty if no data)).
- Right-Aligned Explanations
&gt; For detailed explanations, align comments to the right of the code, ensuring the primary focus remains on the code itself.
- Detailed Inline Comments
&gt; Include comments for complex operations or variable initializations, explaining their purpose succinctly and directly above the code.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Conditional Statements
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly label conditionals with comments to outline logic flow and maintain code continuity.
- Initial Above-Line Comment
&gt; Start each conditional block with a concise comment that ends with 'Conditional' for immediate context.
- Clear Labeling
&gt; Provide straightforward comments before conditionals to make the code's flow easily understandable.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Explicit Loop Descriptions
<blockquote>
<p>Describe loops' purposes before they begin, stating what is being iterated over and why.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Return Statement Precision
<blockquote>
<p>Ensure return statements are direct and formatted without superfluous spaces, clearly grouping all related properties.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Setting Attributes
<blockquote>
<p>Detail HTML attributes to enhance code clarity and understanding, promoting a uniform and accessible codebase.
- Comment Every Attribute
&gt; Add a comment before each attribute assignment describing its purpose, starting with 'Assign' for setting a value and 'Initialize' for placeholders.
- Clarify Purpose and Value
&gt; Clarify the source or purpose when setting values, especially for dynamic ones (e.g., // Assign Current Contact Primary Phone).
- Maintain Readability
&gt; Align attribute settings and their comments to improve readability and comprehension.
- Consistent Commenting Style
&gt; Adopt a consistent style for attribute comments across the codebase for uniformity.
&gt;</p>
</blockquote></li>

&gt; Challenges: May contain inconsistencies, missing fields, or formatting errors.
- API Data (Verified Data)
&gt; Source: External API responses (e.g., Google Address Validation API).
&gt; Purpose: Used to validate and enhance the parsed data, such as verifying addresses or extracting geographic components.
&gt; Challenges: API responses may differ from the parsed data, lack context, or omit critical components (e.g., suite information).
- Database Data (Existing Data)
&gt; Source: Database queries that return information about existing entities, locations, or contacts.
&gt; Purpose: Used to identify duplicates, verify the existence of entities or locations, and establish relationships between data components.
&gt; Challenges: Database data may be outdated, incomplete, or formatted differently from the parsed and API data.
- Helper Notes #notcomplete
&gt; Helper notes are phrases or keywords included in the raw text to guide the AI in assigning specific attributes. Examples include phrases like &quot;This contact is a jurisdiction,&quot; &quot;billing contact,&quot; or &quot;He knows Bob in Accounting.&quot; These notes help ensure that critical details are captured accurately in the final parsed data.
- Review Process #notcomplete
&gt; The server-side code generates a JSON object containing parsed contact details, which will be prefilled in a modal form for the user to review. The form will allow users to view, edit, and confirm or reject each proposed contact entry.
&gt;
- Modal Page Overview
&gt; The review form will look similar to the existing contact entry form (as shown in the attachment). Each field will be editable so the user can make changes before accepting or rejecting the proposed contact.

- Pagination and Navigation
&gt; Pagination and Navigation
- Accept/Reject Options
&gt; The user will review and choose to accept or reject the proposed contact.
&gt;
- Accept
&gt; If the user accepts a proposed contact, the details will be confirmed and prepared for insertion into the database.
- Reject
&gt; If the user rejects the proposed contact, it will be removed from the current JSON object, and the next proposed contact will be shown.
- Final Review and Updates
&gt; After reviewing all the proposed contacts, the JSON object will be updated with any accepted contacts, and any rejected contacts will be discarded.  The user can accept multiple contacts in a session, but each contact must be reviewed before it is added to the system.
&gt;
- Adding New Contacts
&gt; If new bulk contacts are added while there are still pending contacts to be reviewed, the new contacts will be appended to the existing JSON object. This allows for continuous processing without losing any pending entries.</p>

<li>Single Session Enforcement #notcomplete
<blockquote>
<p>The site has a login / logout architecture that maintains a clean and consistent user activity log.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Code Guidlines
<blockquote>
<p>Here they are
- 1. Define the Instructions as Persistent Guidelines
- Log Messages
- Header Comment:
- Every log message should be preceded by a comment beginning with // Log Message, followed by a parenthetical description in Title Case.
- The parenthetical description should match the log message content (second argument in logMessage()).
- Comment Format:
- Example:
- php
- Copy code
- // Log Message (Processing Contact)
- logMessage('S', &quot;Processing Contact #&quot; . $index, null, false, null);
- Title Case Rules:
- Capitalize main words in the description, avoiding excessive capitalization.
- Variable Assignment Comments
- Always Use 'Assign':
- Start each comment with // Assign [Variable Name] to describe what is being assigned.
- Example:
- php
- Copy code
- // Assign Parsed Contact
- $parsedContact = processContactData($rawData);
- Follow with a Brief Description:
- Add a concise narrative explanation after the code, separated by a comment:
- php
- Copy code
- // Assign Parsed Contact
- $parsedContact = processContactData($rawData); // Process and parse raw contact data
- 2. Embed These Guidelines in Context for Consistency
- You can request that the AI:
- Use the Guidelines by Default:
- Incorporate these as default practices whenever coding examples are generated.
- Include the Preferences in the User Profile:
- Add the instructions as coding preferences in the AI's persistent user profile to ensure adherence across sessions.
- 3. Example Context Update for AI
- Here’s how you can relay this information to the AI for future use:
- Coding Preferences:
- Log Messages: Use // Log Message as the header for all log statements. Include a parenthetical description in Title Case, matching the log message content.
- Variable Assignments: Use // Assign [Variable Name] as the comment for variable assignments, followed by a brief narrative description after the code.
- 4. Test the Implementation
- To ensure these guidelines are consistently followed:
- Provide a small test task with specific requirements.
- Evaluate whether the generated code adheres to the guidelines.
- Adjust the instructions as needed for clarity or specificity.</p>
