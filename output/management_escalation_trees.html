<h1>🧭 Management Escalation Trees and Governance Frameworks</h1>
<h2>🏷️ Purpose</h2>
<p>Provide a clear, fair, and enforceable system of operational governance across the organization using structured escalation trees built into Skyesoft.</p>
<h2>🛠️ Technical Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Escalation Chains: Employee → Supervisor → Department Head → Ownership</li>
<li>Trigger Conditions: Attendance issues, missed deadlines, permit delays, job costing overruns</li>
<li>Lockout Actions: Certain unresolved escalations can trigger auto-lockout requiring ownership override</li>
<li>Full Activity Logs: All escalations timestamped, GPS-located, tracked by user</li>
</ul>
<h2>🎯 Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remove subjectivity and favoritism from management</li>
<li>Protect company profitability and operational continuity</li>
<li>Empower frontline managers with clear support processes</li>
<li>Reduce owner firefighting by forcing lower-level resolution first</li>
</ul>
<h2>🏗️ Implementation Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Escalation tree must be customizable by department</li>
<li>Lockout screens must be mobile-responsive</li>
<li>Ownership approval system built with audit trail</li>
</ul>
