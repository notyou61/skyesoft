Proposal: Lead or Sell – Not Both</h1>

<h2 id="purpose">🎯 Purpose</h2>
<p>To eliminate structural conflicts of interest by ending the practice
of allowing managers to function as commissioned salespeople. This
proposal addresses the operational, financial, and cultural consequences
of this dual-role arrangement and provides a clear pathway to restore
fairness, accountability, and client trust.</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">🧠 Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Currently, managers are permitted to operate as commissioned
salespeople. This has led to a pattern of behavior that prioritizes
personal profit over team success and customer satisfaction. These
manager-salespeople leverage their internal authority to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize their own jobs in scheduling and production queues<br />
</li>
<li>Push their material orders and change requests ahead of others<br />
</li>
<li>Collect commissions on expedited projects while other salespeople’s
jobs stall</li>
</ul>
<p>Worse still, they use deposit funds from other reps’ customers to
finance their own projects, leaving those original jobs unfunded,
delayed, and exposed.</p>
<p>In many cases, vendors, subcontractors, permit fees, and sales tax
obligations go unpaid—not due to oversight, but because funds are
redirected to satisfy internal favoritism. The salesperson who sold the
job is left answering for missed deadlines and legal non-compliance,
despite following the process.</p>
<p>This is not just a leadership misstep. It is a system built to
benefit those in power at the expense of those doing the work.</p>
<h2 id="observed-impacts">📉 Observed Impacts</h2>
<ul>
<li>🚀 Fast-tracked jobs for managers, bypassing internal approval
gates<br />
</li>
<li>💰 Misuse of job deposits, depriving original projects of timely
funding<br />
</li>
<li>⚠️ Unpaid permit fees and unremitted sales tax, exposing the company
to liability<br />
</li>
<li>😔 Disengaged sales team, demoralized by a visibly rigged
system<br />
</li>
<li>⏳ Client dissatisfaction, stemming from preventable delays on paid
work<br />
</li>
<li>📉 Loss of credibility, internally and externally</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recommendations">✅ Recommendations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>🚫 Eliminate Commission for Managers</strong>
<ul>
<li>👔 Managers should not earn commissions while exercising control
over production, scheduling, or resource allocation.<br />
</li>
<li>🔄 If a manager wishes to earn commission, they must step out of
leadership and join the sales force on equal footing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>💼 Realign Manager Compensation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Transition to salary + bonus structure, where bonuses are tied to:
<ul>
<li>Team performance metrics<br />
</li>
<li>On-time project delivery<br />
</li>
<li>Client satisfaction ratings<br />
</li>
<li>Backlog reduction and internal compliance</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>📑 Enforce Deposit Integrity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deposits must be applied only to the project they were received
for<br />
</li>
<li>No cross-allocation without written approval and documentation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>📋 Require Financial Compliance Before Scheduling</strong>
<ul>
<li>No job should enter production or installation without:
<ul>
<li>Permit fees paid<br />
</li>
<li>Sales tax properly logged<br />
</li>
<li>Job cost allocations verified</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>🔍 Establish Resource Allocation Transparency</strong>
<ul>
<li>Job queue priorities should be auditable and enforced without
exceptions<br />
</li>
<li>No individual should be allowed to move their own job ahead of
others without process-based justification</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>🗣️ Center Transparency and Communication in All Leadership
Practices</strong>
<ul>
<li>Make internal decisions visible and explainable to team
members.<br />
</li>
<li>Share not just what decisions are made—but why.<br />
</li>
<li>This builds trust, empowers collaboration, and reinforces Habit 5
from <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>: Seek First to
Understand, Then to Be Understood.<br />
</li>
<li>When people understand the reasoning behind actions, resistance
drops and alignment increases.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">🔚 Conclusion</h2>
<p>This proposal is not about punishing individuals. It is about
removing a structural flaw that invites abuse.</p>
<p>If we want a culture of trust, accountability, and excellence—we must
start with leadership integrity. Managers cannot lead teams they are
also quietly competing against. When the people in charge are also the
ones benefiting from systemic loopholes, the organization rots from the
inside.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership must choose: Lead, or sell. Not both.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s build a system that rewards collaboration, fairness, and real
leadership. The rest—morale, performance, retention, and client
trust—will follow.</p>
