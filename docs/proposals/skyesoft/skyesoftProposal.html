  <section id="the-problem" class="no-break">
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Most off-the-shelf software, like Jobscope or NetSuite, falls short

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Overly complex</strong>: Bloated interfaces that overwhelm
  users.</li>
  <li><strong>Costly</strong>: Expensive deployment and maintenance
  fees.</li>
  <li><strong>Generic</strong>: Not tailored to the unique workflows of
  sign companies or field-based operations. Teams often rely on
  fragmented tools—email, spreadsheets, CRMs—that lack real-time
  coordination and context, leading to inefficiency and missed
  opportunities.</li>
  </ul>
