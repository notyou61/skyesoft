## 🎯 Purpose

Demonstrate how Skyesoft streamlines on-site service close-out using geo-tagging, photo verification, and alerting—delivering exceptional service while embodying **Covey’s Habit 2: Begin With the End in Mind**.

---

## 📞 The Call (Narrative Introduction)

::: no-break
It’s late afternoon when the phone rings at Christy Signs' front desk. Coast Signs explains that a patch and paint job hasn’t been completed, though the customer expects it closed out immediately.

Without leadership present, the crew risks leaving the job unfinished — triggering callbacks, reputational damage, and lost time.

**Skyesoft ensures we complete with confidence, not assumption.**

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Actors & Roles

- **Receptionist** – Fielding the incoming call and verifying ticket status  
- **Install Crew** – Responsible for physical work and close-out  
- **Install Manager** – Monitoring job completion and responding to alerts  
- **Account Rep** – Liaison with customer; confirms expectations and status

## 📋 Preconditions

- Order is created and tagged: `Completion Photos Required`  
- Geo-fence is set (e.g., `10411 N 35th Ave`)  
- Crew is equipped with the **Skyesoft Mobile App**

   Skyesoft detects arrival inside designated geo-fence.

2. **Perform Work**  
   Job steps completed per scope.

3. **Request to Leave Protocol**  
   Technician presses “Ready to Leave” — triggers validation workflow.

4. **Photo Verification Required**  
   Skyesoft blocks exit until completion photos are submitted.

5. **Automated Alerts**  
   System notifies Install Manager and Account Rep of close-out request.

6. **Manager & Rep Review**  
   Photos and time log are verified inside Skyesoft.

7. **Close-Out & Customer Notification**  
   System generates automated close-out email with images attached.

- Manual follow-ups  
- Third-party tracking apps  
- ✅ Skyesoft’s native geo-exit protocol with alerts and media

**Best Solution?**
