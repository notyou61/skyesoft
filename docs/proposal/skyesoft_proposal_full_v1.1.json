      "content": "Most businesses rely on a variety of software tools\u2014each serving a single department or function\u2014but these tools often don\u2019t communicate with each other. This creates disconnected systems, scattered data, and a lack of coordination between the office and the field. The result? Processes that are harder to track, teams that work in silos, delays, inefficiencies, and miscommunication that cost time and money."
