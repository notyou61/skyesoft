# Real-Time SSE – Purpose & Application

## 🧭 Primary Role
To provide an efficient, always-on communication channel between the server and client browsers using Server-Sent Events (SSE). This enables live updates for status tracking, data changes, and interactive interfaces — all without constant polling or refreshes.

## 🧱 Core Functions
- Deliver live updates to the browser with minimal overhead.
- Push permit status, jobsite activity, and progress updates instantly.
- Connect seamlessly with the Time Interval Standards to reflect changes in real-time during Worktime.

## ⚙️ Implementation Notes
- The server emits `text/event-stream` responses.
- Each relevant backend module publishes events to connected clients based on:
  - Order progression
  - Permit milestones
  - Escalation changes
  - New contact or task entries

## 💡 Example Use Cases
- A foreman submits a field note, and the office receives it instantly.
- A permit status changes from “Submitted” to “Approved,” and all connected users see this reflected live.
- A bulletin is updated — no page reload necessary.

## 🔒 Considerations
- SSE is ideal for **one-way server-to-client** updates.
- Connection fallback strategies (like retry on disconnect) should be built-in.
- For more interactive use cases (chat, bidirectional control), consider WebSockets.

🔁 Closely integrated with:
- `time-interval-standards.md` – to respect working hours and delay dispatching updates outside active time windows
- `management_escalation_trees.md` – to auto-trigger urgent alerts as changes propagate
