# Management Escalation Trees

### 🌐 Purpose

Management Escalation Trees (MET) define how alerts, exceptions, and overdue tasks are escalated through a structured chain of responsibility. This ensures time-sensitive matters are addressed with appropriate urgency based on the assigned team, role, or location.

---

### 🔄 Trigger Sources

Escalation trees are activated by:

* Missed turn-around times (TAT) derived from **Time Interval Standards**
* Threshold breaches (e.g. excessive idle time, overdue order status)
* Permit delays or stalled service steps
* Attendance anomalies (e.g. unapproved absence)
* Exceptions in automated workflows (e.g. form validation failures)

---

### ✉️ Alert Types

* **Direct Message**: Individual or group via preferred channel (email, SMS, dashboard ping)
* **Escalation Message**: Sent to next level after defined interval
* **Broadcast Alert**: Emergency-level notice to all relevant managers

---

### ⚖️ Escalation Rules

Each rule set defines:

* ⏰ Time to escalate from original handler
* 👨‍💼 Role or title to receive the escalation
* ⚡ Priority level (Low, Normal, High, Critical)
* 📅 Repeat interval if unacknowledged
* 🔐 Optionally encrypted for sensitive issues

---

### 📊 Logging & SLA Tracking

All escalations are logged:

* Date/time of alert and each escalation step
* Who acknowledged and when
* Final resolution timestamp

Used to:

* Report SLA compliance
* Audit responsiveness
* Inform future automation tuning

---

### ⚙️ Integration

Escalation trees are integrated with:

* **Real-Time SSE** feeds for live triggering
* **Core Database** for contact, role, and responsibility resolution
* **Attendance Suite**, **Permit System**, and **Order Tracker** for actionable events

---

### 🪡 Example

**Scenario**: Sign permit delay reaches 48 hours with no city response.

1. System flags permit as stalled
2. Initial handler is notified
3. After 4 hours no action: escalated to supervisor
4. After 8 more hours: alert broadcast to regional manager
5. All actions logged and visible in audit trail

---

### 🚀 Objective

Ensure no critical task falls through the cracks. MET provides clarity, accountability, and responsiveness across operational workflows.

### 🔧 Notes

* Configurable per department, location, or customer
* Editable escalation tree via admin panel
* Override options with justification for manual control
