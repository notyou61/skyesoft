# üìÅ File Management Suite

## üß≠ Primary Role
To provide a centralized and modular system for storing, linking, retrieving, and tagging files such as documents, images, forms, and scanned records ‚Äî fully integrated with Skyesoft‚Äôs core database and accessible across all modules.

---

## üîß Key Capabilities

- **Upload & Tagging**
  - Files can be uploaded from desktop, mobile, or scanned input.
  - Each file can be tagged by:
    - Module (`Permit`, `Order`, `Contact`, etc.)
    - Record ID
    - File Type (`PDF`, `Image`, `Form`, etc.)
    - Category (`Job Photo`, `Final Approval`, etc.)

- **Record Linking**
  - Each file is stored in a secure directory with an associated metadata row.
  - Files are linked to specific record types via `tableName` and `recordId` values.
  - Example: `file ‚Üí permits (table), ID #11542`

- **Access Control**
  - Read/write permissions based on user role (`Admin`, `Permit Agent`, `Field Rep`)
  - Internal use vs. public or client-facing document access

- **File Previews & Quick Access**
  - Inline preview support (PDF, JPG, PNG) within admin panel
  - Quick download link and audit trail for each file access event

- **Audit & Version Control**
  - Every upload is logged with `uploadedBy`, `timestamp`, and `ipAddress`
  - Optional version stacking (retain old versions)

- **Storage Paths & Redundancy**
  - Directory structure follows: `/files/[year]/[module]/[recordId]/[filename]`
  - Files stored locally and optionally mirrored to cloud (OneDrive/Drive)
