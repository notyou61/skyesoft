# 🌟 **Skyesoft: Restoring Ownership and Growth**

---

## 💡 The Problem
- Leadership avoids hard conversations
- Talented people lack structure and discipline
- "Strong GM" plan won't fix broken systems

---

## ⚠️ The Deeper Risk (Sun Tzu)
- Emotional resistance to losing personal control
- Some would rather "rule over ashes" than share power

---

## 🔄 The Growth Path (Stephen Covey)
- **Dependence** ➡️ **Independence** ➡️ **Interdependence**
- Synergy: **1 + 1 = 3 or more**
