## 📊 3. Key Assumptions

| Factor | Value | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Labor Billing Rate | $105.00/hour | Fixed rate for service calls |
| Billable Hours Per Day | 6.5 hours | Fair productivity assumption |
| Billable Days Per Month | 21 days | Accounting for PTO, holidays |
| Sales Commission | 10% of total revenue | Applies to labor + material |
| Material Pricing Method | Average vendor cost × 2.5 markup | Margin protection strategy |
| Working Weeks Per Year | 50 weeks | Assuming 2 weeks PTO |

::: no-break

| Timeframe | Result |
|:---|:---|
| Billable Hours Per Day | 6.5 hours |
| Billable Hours Per Week | 32.5 hours |
| Billable Hours Per Month | 136.5 hours |
| Billable Hours Per Year | 1,625 hours |
| Labor Revenue Per Month | $14,332.50 |
| Labor Revenue Per Year | $170,625 |

*Material revenue will vary based on parts used per ticket, using the 2.5× markup model.*

## 📦 5. Material Pricing Methodology

- Collect cost data from **multiple approved vendors** (minimum of 2).
- **Average** the cost quotes.
- **Apply 2.5× markup** to the averaged cost to determine customer billing price.

**Example:**
- Vendor A: $95
- Vendor B: $105
- Vendor C: $100
- **Average Cost = $100**
- **Sale Price = $250** (2.5 × $100)

This ensures stable margins (approximately 60%) regardless of supplier pricing fluctuations.

## 💸 6. Revenue Flow

```
Labor Revenue (Hours × $105)
+ Material Revenue (Average Vendor Cost × 2.5)
= Total Revenue

- Sales Commission (10% of Total Revenue)
= Net Service Revenue (Before Vehicle, Technician, and Overhead Costs)
```

---

## 📌 7. Next Steps

1. **Quantify Fixed Costs:**  
   - Technician wage, burden (taxes, insurance)  
   - Truck lease, insurance, fuel, maintenance  
   - Allocated overhead (admin, office, software, Skyesoft)

2. **Estimate Materials Mix:**  
   - Gather typical parts used per ticket to model material contribution.

3. **Calculate Break-Even:**  
   - Determine minimum required billable hours and material sales to cover all costs + generate target profit.

4. **Scenario Testing:**  
   - Model variations (lower ticket volume months, reduced billable hours, parts-heavy jobs, etc.)
