## Document Type & Naming
This document is a **Use Case** (also known as a **Feature Use Case** or **User Story**). Use cases are standard practice for capturing how a system’s features support real‑world workflows, detailing actors, preconditions, and step‑by‑step flows to illustrate value.

## Purpose
To demonstrate how **Skyesoft** streamlines on‑site service close‑out, enforces quality through geo‑tagging, and maintains accountability—ultimately delivering superior customer service and embodying Stephen Covey’s **Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw**.

## Actors & Roles
- **Receptionist**: Receives customer calls and views order status.
- **Install Crew**: Executes on‑site work and interacts with the mobile app.
- **Install Manager**: Oversees crew activities and reviews completion.
- **Account Representative**: Monitors orders, communicates with the customer.

## Preconditions
1. Order “Patch & Paint Wall” is created in Skyesoft and tagged **Completion Photos Required**.
2. Site coordinates geo‑fence defined for the location (e.g., 10411 N 35th Ave).
3. Crew has company‑issued mobile device with Skyesoft mobile app.

## Main Flow
1. **Crew Arrival & Geo‑Check**: When the crew reaches the site, their phone’s GPS triggers a check‑in—Skyesoft marks them **On Site** only within the geo‑fence radius.
2. **Perform Work**: Crew patches and paints the wall according to the order scope.
3. **Request to Leave Protocol**:
   - Crew remains geo‑tagged inside the boundary until all tasks complete.
   - Tapping **Request to Leave** outside the fence without approval triggers an alert.
4. **Photo Verification**:
   - Crew uploads timestamped photos of the completed patch and paint.
   - Skyesoft flags these for review by the Install Manager.
5. **Automated Alerts**:
   - If the crew exits early, Skyesoft alerts the Install Manager and Account Rep via in‑app and SMS notifications.
6. **Manager & Rep Review**:
   - Install Manager approves photos or requests corrections.
   - Account Representative can join the in‑order chat to add notes or confirmations.
7. **Order Close‑Out & Customer Communication**:
   - Upon approval, Skyesoft emails completion photos to the customer in real time.
   - Order status changes to **Closed**.
