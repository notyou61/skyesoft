# 🧭 Management Escalation Trees and Governance Frameworks

## 🏷️ Purpose
Provide a clear, fair, and enforceable system of operational governance across the organization using structured escalation trees built into Skyesoft.

## 🛠️ Technical Details
- Escalation Chains: Employee → Supervisor → Department Head → Ownership
- Trigger Conditions: Attendance issues, missed deadlines, permit delays, job costing overruns
- Lockout Actions: Certain unresolved escalations can trigger auto-lockout requiring ownership override
- Full Activity Logs: All escalations timestamped, GPS-located, tracked by user

## 🎯 Key Features
- Remove subjectivity and favoritism from management
- Protect company profitability and operational continuity
- Empower frontline managers with clear support processes
- Reduce owner firefighting by forcing lower-level resolution first

## 🏗️ Implementation Notes
- Escalation tree must be customizable by department
- Lockout screens must be mobile-responsive
- Ownership approval system built with audit trail
