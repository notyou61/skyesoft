            "heading": "Executive Summary",
            "body": "Currently, managers are permitted to operate as commissioned salespeople. This has led to a pattern of behavior that prioritizes personal profit over team success and customer satisfaction. These manager-salespeople leverage their internal authority to:\n\n- Prioritize their own jobs in scheduling and production queues\n- Push their material orders and change requests ahead of others\n- Collect commissions on expedited projects while other salespeople\u2019s jobs stall\n\nWorse still, they use deposit funds from other reps\u2019 customers to finance their own projects, leaving those original jobs unfunded, delayed, and exposed.\n\nIn many cases, vendors, subcontractors, permit fees, and sales tax obligations go unpaid\u2014not due to oversight, but because funds are redirected to satisfy internal favoritism. The salesperson who sold the job is left answering for missed deadlines and legal non-compliance, despite following the process.\n\nThis is not just a leadership misstep. It is a system built to benefit those in power at the expense of those doing the work."
